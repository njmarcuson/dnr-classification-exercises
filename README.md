To open the project, open the file "dnr-classification-exercises.Rproj" in the root directory, which will open an RStudio environment.

To run the solutions, open the files "exercise1/mainFunction1.R" and "exercise2/mainFunction2.R" within the RStudio environment, and hit the "Source" button on both files. If this produces a "No such file or directory" error, run the command `setwd('/path/to/dnr-classification-exercises')` in the console with your path.
